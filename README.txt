Special thanks to the JavaScript30 Coding Challenge for providing me with help for this project.
I went through the tutorial and created the project, but then created a second without the tutorial,
taking subtle references from the first-time-around if I needed help. It has really helped ingrain 
CSS3/JavaScript into my mind. 


My opinions on the project:

It was fun writing the HTML, learning how I can turn a keystroke into an interaction. Also I learned
how to import audio into my HTML5 page, which can be useful for future projects.

I have also learned my first ES6 material in this project, which is a big step forward. ES6 really has 
great potential and abilities - I know I will be using it in my future projects.
