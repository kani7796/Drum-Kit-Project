My opinions on the project:

It was fun writing the HTML, learning how I can turn a keystroke into an interaction. Also I learned
how to import audio into my HTML5 page, which can be useful for future projects.

I have also learned my first ES6 material in this project, which is a big step forward. ES6 really has 
great potential and abilities - I know I will be using it in my future projects.
